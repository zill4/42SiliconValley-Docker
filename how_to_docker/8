# Launch a shell from an alpine container, make sure that you can interact directly with the container
# via your terminal, and that the container deletes itself once the shell's execution is done.
docker run -it --rm alpine /bin/sh
# -i Interactive keeps STDIN open even if not attached
# -t Allocate the pseudo-TTY
# -rm Automatically remove the container when it exits
# Usually Alpine Linux doesn't contain bash, instead you use /bin/ash, bin/sh, ash, or only sh.
