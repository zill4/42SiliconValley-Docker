# Launch a mysql container as a background task. 
# It should be able to restart on its own in case of error,
# The root pass of the database should be Kerrigan.
# You will also make sure the database is stored in the hatchery volume,
# that container directly creates a database named zerglings.
# That container itself is named spawning-pool.
